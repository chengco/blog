At the beginning of the conversation, people could say “How are you? “ “How are you doing?” “How is it going?”  “Hey, how is going?”, how to answer these questions under this situation? what should I say? It confuses me a lot until I know there are no much different among these expressions.  Most of the time, when people say “how is it going”, it’s just a greeting like say “Hi”. It’s not really a real question, people are not asking you to give them some stories of your life. It’s just a simple greeting.

You can answer: 

- Pretty good.
- I’m good/great.
- It’s going pretty good. Thanks. yourself?
- It’s going alright, how about you?
- I’m doing good/great. and you?

Basically, there are three parts in the answer. First part is to answer the question, second part is to say thanks, the last part is to ask back “how are you” or “how are you doing”. It’s very polite to ask someone back “how is it going?” you? yourself? and you? and yourself? how about you? how about yourself? there are a lot of different options, you don’t need memorize one, you can choose any of them.

For the answers above, they are all positive. In most cases, should give a positive answer, also you can give a negative answer if you want, like

- Things have been better
- It’s not going too great
- Today’s not going very well, How about you?

Maybe you feel sick, maybe lose something.
